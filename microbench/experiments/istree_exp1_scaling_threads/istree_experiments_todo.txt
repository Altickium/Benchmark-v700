exp1: scaling vs threads (k=2m,20m,200m,2b; u=0%,1%,10%,40%)

exp2: memory consumption for static tree (ignoring working set for updates is relevant for search dominated)

exp3: impact of multi counter at root

exp4: impact of collaborative rebalancing

exp: rebuilding
    how many are there?
    how effective is helping?
    what fraction of the execution is spent on rebalancing?

exp: how effective is interpolation?
    uniform
    non-uniform

exp: stats about the trees (shape of trees, etc)

picture of small tree generated via graphviz to demonstrate the layout?

    [?] relative invariance of results with changes in allocator/reclamation and even system architecture

recall: should explain how we reclaim memory
